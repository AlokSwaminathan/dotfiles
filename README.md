# My Dotfiles

## Components
**nvim/**    My main editor (one day). rn it is basically just the Kickstarter config, but hopefully, it'll become usable soon. I just use lazyvim while I'm building it

**sway/**    WM config. On top of the config file, has scripts for notifications, screenshots, and png for my lock screen

**tofi/**    Tofi config, lightweight Wayland dmenu, not in use rn since it doesn't support icons and the millisecond diff isn't that noticeable

**rofi/**    Rofi config, slower than tofi but has icons and also works with opened windows so I like it more

**fish/**    Config for my main shell, has a lot of functions I've randomly made and some plugins

**foot/**    Main terminal emulator, really fast with no extra features but I don't really need those

**dunst/**    Notification daemon config, just some basic styling options so the notifs show up the way I like them

**i3status-rs/**    Status bar config, this one is minimal and looks nice, just using basic widgets with some signals attached so they update when I change things like brightness and volume


### Missing
tmux (or zellij maybe), some sort of clipboard manager
